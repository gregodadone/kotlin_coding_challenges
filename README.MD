# KOTLIN CODING CHALLENGES

## PrimeOrNot
This program should accept an array of numbers. It should iterate through the array of numbers and determine if each is prime or not. Once it’s done processing, it should return only those numbers that are prime in an array.

## ReverseStringWithoutReverseMethod
This exercise will teach you about how Java handles strings. First, you should create a class with a main method that accepts a string and then returns a string where the characters are in reverse order. But, you can't use the reverse method of the String class because that’d be cheating.

## Singleton
The singleton pattern is a design pattern that restricts the instantiation of an object to only one instance. To do this, you’ll need to create a Singleton class that has a non-parameterized constructor.

The class should have one public variable called str. It should also have a static method called getSingleInstance that’ll return the single instance of the class.
