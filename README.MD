# KOTLIN CODING CHALLENGES

## PrimeOrNot
This program should accept an array of numbers. It should iterate through the array of numbers and determine if each is prime or not. Once it’s done processing, it should return only those numbers that are prime in an array.

## ReverseStringWithoutReverseMethod
This exercise will teach you about how Java handles strings. First, you should create a class with a main method that accepts a string and then returns a string where the characters are in reverse order. But, you can't use the reverse method of the String class because that’d be cheating.

## Singleton
The singleton pattern is a design pattern that restricts the instantiation of an object to only one instance. To do this, you’ll need to create a Singleton class that has a non-parameterized constructor.

The class should have one public variable called str. It should also have a static method called getSingleInstance that’ll return the single instance of the class.

## AnagramStrings
Write a function to check whether two given strings are anagram of each other or not. An anagram of a string is another string that contains the same characters, only the order of characters can be different. For example, “abcd” and “dabc” are an anagram of each other.

## PhoneToWordList
Given a 10 digit phone number, you must return all possible words or combination of words from the provided dictionary, that can be mapped back as a whole to the number.

With this we can generate numbers like 1-800-motortruck which is easier to remember then 1-800-6686787825

The phone number mapping to letters is as follows:

2 = a b c
3 = d e f
4 = g h i
5 = j k l
6 = m n o
7 = p q r s
8 = t u v
9 = w x y z
The phone numbers will never contain a 0 or 1. Words have to be at least 3 characters.

To get give you an initial verifiation, the following must be true:

6686787825 should return the following list [["motor", "usual"], ["noun", "struck"], ["nouns", "truck"], ["nouns", "usual"], ["onto", "struck"], "motortruck"] # These words exist in a dictionary file.

The conversion of a 10 digit phone number should be performed within 1000ms.
